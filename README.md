## Food Pantry - Ruby on Rails

Our goal is to develop a food pantry for students in a university, who can have access to enough food to eat. We want to create a system to manage the inventory of a food pantry, as well as generate reports about the pantry's activities. We are trying to design a website that manages the information. The system keeps track of all the information and students will check out items by visiting the food pantry in person, selecting items, and then checking out with a food pantry staff member.
