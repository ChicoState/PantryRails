# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in PantryRails Project. Our goal is to develop a food pantry for students in a university, who can have access to enough food to eat. We want to create a system to manage the inventory of a food pantry, as well as generate reports about the pantry's activities. We are trying to design a website that manages the information.

# Contributions

PantryRail welcomes contributions from everyone.

Contributions to PantryRails should be made in the form of GitHub pull requests. Each pull request will be reviewed by a core contributor (someone with permission) and either landed in the main tree or given feedback for changes that would be required.
